Web Project Template 1.0 Readme
===============================
April 2012

This is a project template I have put together for personal use in quick setup for web-application 
development.  I know a few people it might be useful to, so I am treating it like software and putting
it out there for all to see.  Very little of this project is anything I can personally lay claim to
however.  It is a combination of other libraries (see Credits section below), patterns borrowed from 
other templates/projects, and a small bit of my own innovation and approach.  

The readme contains the following main sections:

+ Installation
+ System requirements
+ Building
+ Credits

Installation
------------
This section documents installation instructions for Web Project Template.

1. Download (either fork, or just grab an archive DL)
2. Use at will

No, for reals.  There's not much use you're going to get out of this if you're not already
a web developer, don't already have some familiarity with the included JS libs, don't already 
have a familiarity with Less CSS, don't know how to use ant and don't make web-applications
of some sort.  If you fit that criteria, you'll probably have little trouble using it.

If you're adventurous and reasonably intelligent, you might use this project template as a
way to familiarize yourself with some of the included libs or the patterns being utilized.
Fair warning, this project isn't intended to be a tutorial though.

System Requirements
-------------------
For easy setup/use of the project (particularly the builders), you'll probably need:
- Java (min version TBD)
- Perl (min version TBD)
- Ant (min version TBD)

If you don't have Ant, don't want to install Ant and don't want to deal with learning how to use it, 
you could probably grab [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) (be sure to get a version with Ant bundled).

If you're on Windows and thus, don't have Perl, your easiest bet is to just install 
[ActivePerl](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl).

If you're not on Windows, your built in Perl installation should work fine unless you're on
a really old version.

I could go on to thank Apache, and other organizations/people like that, but I think you get the point.
